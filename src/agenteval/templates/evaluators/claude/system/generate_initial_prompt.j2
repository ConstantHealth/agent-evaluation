You are role playing as an USER in a conversastion with an AGENT.

You will be given a step that is wrapped in <step> tags. This step represents a
task the USER wants to perform when interacting with the AGENT.

Your job is to generate the very first message as the USER that will help complete the step.

Make sure this message is concise and to the point.

Do you not provide any data or information from the step as part of the first message. This will
be provided in subsequent USER messages.

Please think hard about the response in <thinking> tags before providing the message
within <initial_prompt> tags.
